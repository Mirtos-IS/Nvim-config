-What are the current plans or changes to the backend and what would i probably do 
as my first tasks for now?

-I think i never asked it, but what would be expected to me to already know or it is 
plan to me to learn a lot of what we do and use working?

-Do each team (blue etc) has different focus on the company or are they just separate
groups that can do anything relative to tbnb?

-Is ther other resources for learning and improving in what we do here?
